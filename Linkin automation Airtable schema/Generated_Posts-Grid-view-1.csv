""I thought my Indian tax filing was done - until I missed the new deadline.""

A client working in Silicon Valley assumed the July 31 deadline still applied to his India income. He missed the updated date and ended up with penalties.

Here's what changed:

The income tax return (ITR) deadline for NRIs (non-audit cases) is now **16 September 2025**. If your case requires audit, it's **31 October 2025**, and **30 November 2025** if transfer pricing applies.

Miss this, and you'll need to file a belated return by **31 December 2025**, with late fees and possible interest.

He had rental income in India above ₹2.5 lakh. That triggered the filing requirement.

We helped him:
- File ITR-2 for FY 2024-25
- Declare India income with accurate TDS credits
- Avoid further penalties via Form 67 (for DTAA claim)

What caught him off guard: delays in US tax filing had ripple effects in India.

India deadlines now extend further, but the preparation still takes time.

Takeaway: Align your India tax calendar with US obligations 3 months in advance.

Have you mapped your India and US compliance deadlines together?

3 key tax deadlines every NRI should bookmark for FY 2024-25

Staying compliant across borders isn't about complexity. It's about timing.

Here’s the simplified India tax calendar for NRIs:

1. **ITR Filing** (Non-audit): Due **16 September 2025** (officially extended)
2. **Audit-required returns**: Due **31 October 2025**
3. **Transfer pricing cases**: File by **30 November 2025**

Missed the original dates?
You can file a belated return until **31 December 2025**, but expect penalties.

If your Indian income exceeds ₹2.5 lakh, filing is mandatory. Rental income and capital gains count. Use ITR-2 unless you're running a business (then use ITR-3).

NRI tax exemptions under the new regime cap at ₹4 lakh. The ₹12 lakh rebate? That’s only for returning NRIs classified as RNOR.

Plan accordingly:
- Watch the 120-day presence rule (effective April 1, 2026)
- Maintain TDS records and Form 67 for DTAA
- Update your ITR forms once simplified versions launch (Jan 2026)

Takeaway: A 15-minute calendar check today can save hours of tax recovery later.

How early do you start preparing for India tax filing?

532,16,1,2,NRI_CrossBorder_Wealth,C,"Variant C: Data-led insight with surprising statistic

30% TDS on rent. 20% to 30% on capital gains. Often higher than what NRIs actually owe.

That’s what we’re seeing with many NRI clients.

Take a rental property earning ₹50,000/month in India. TDS at 30% means ₹1.8 lakh withheld annually. But actual tax owed might be far less after deductions.

The issue? Tenants and buyers apply default TDS rates. And most NRIs never file an Indian tax return to claim the refund.

Here's the fix:
- File ITR (use ITR-2) before **16 September 2025**
- Declare India income and claim deductions
- File Form 67 if using DTAA to credit US tax

Bonus: You can recover TDS on long-term gains too, now taxed at **12.5%**, down from 20%.

NRIs also often skip reporting because they assume no tax is due. But thresholds haven’t changed - over ₹2.5 lakh in India income? You need to file.

Takeaway: Don't let high TDS erode your India income. Filing a return isn’t optional.

How much TDS have you left unclaimed in India?

533,16,1,5,Industry_Commentary,A,"Her US tax filing was spotless. Her India ITR? Missed by a month.

Driving her kids to school in Sunnyvale, Radhika thought she'd done everything. W-2 filed, FBAR submitted, 401(k) maxed out. But one email from her CA in India broke that belief.

She'd assumed the July 31 deadline applied to all. But for FY 2024-25, the ITR deadline for NRIs is extended to September 16, 2025. Good news - but only if you know it.

You also have until December 31 to file a belated return. But that includes penalties and interest.

Many NRIs miss this because the rules shift subtly each year. Here’s what Radhika could’ve tracked:
- Is audit required? If yes, your deadline is October 31
- Have transfer pricing transactions? File by November 30
- For most salaried NRIs: no audit, just file by September 16

Being abroad doesn’t exempt you. It gives you more to track.

Takeaway: Even timely US filers can trip on India’s changing deadlines. Read both tax calendars.

534,16,1,5,Industry_Commentary,B,"New India tax rules for NRIs in 2025? Here's what to track.

With changing deadlines and exemptions, NRI tax filing is more complex this year. Here’s a quick breakdown for FY 2024-25:

1. **Deadlines**
   - Non-audit: September 16, 2025
   - Audit cases: October 31, 2025
   - Transfer pricing: November 30, 2025
   - Belated returns: December 31, 2025

2. **Residency rule change** (effective April 2026)
   - Earn over ₹15L in India and stay 120+ days? You may be a Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR)

3. **Tax exemption myths**
   - ₹12L rebate under Section 87A is for residents only
   - NRIs under the new regime get ₹4L basic exemption

4. **Key updates**
   - Real estate LTCG: 12.5% tax (previously 20%)
   - Two properties can now be self-occupied
   - ITR filing window extended to 4 years (for updated returns)

Takeaway: The fine print keeps changing. NRIs need a system to track both US and Indian tax obligations.

535,16,1,5,Industry_Commentary,C,"Did you know NRIs pay 30% TDS on Indian rent, even if actual tax is lower?

This 30% flat TDS on rental income hits thousands of NRI property owners every year. The IRS taxes based on net income. India taxes before you even file.

Even worse, the buyer of your property may deduct 20-30% as TDS on sale - regardless of your capital gains. That’s often more than the final tax liability.

Here's how NRIs can reduce the drag legally:
- File Form 13 to request lower TDS
- Ensure TAN number of tenant/buyer is used
- Reclaim excess tax via ITR-2
- Track timelines: September 16 filing deadline, December 31 for belated returns

Don’t settle for unnecessary tax loss.

Takeaway: High TDS is a rule, not a verdict. You can reduce it with proactive steps.

536,23,1,5,Industry_Commentary,A,"RBI is shifting India's cross-border payments to a fintech-first model. Here's what that really means.

RBI is rolling out a digital payments vision aligned with the G20 roadmap. This means banks and fintechs must share data in real time, with API and compliance workflows moving online.

The core change: India's cross-border transfers could soon run on modern fintech pipes, not local banking silos. For NRIs, this paves the way for instant forex conversions, simpler compliance reporting, and single-platform investment access—functions that today feel piecemeal and slow.

Banks stand to lose monopoly over NRI remittances, while regulated wealth techs can leapfrog into direct partnerships via standard APIs. This is regulatory acknowledgment that platform-centric finance is the likely future. Expect much sharper competition and improved customer experience as API bridges go live.

If you manage NRI wealth or remittances, start assessing fintech partners who can leverage these API channels. Prioritize solutions that offer integrated reporting and robust compliance to reduce manual touchpoints.

Is your cross-border platform ready for RBI-led API integration, or are you still dependent on legacy rails?

537,24,1,2,NRI_CrossBorder_Wealth,A,"Most NRIs will overpay on 2025 taxes because they miss these three moves.

December is not just holiday season. It's your last window to reduce your tax bill across both countries.

I talked to 40 NRIs in our last workshop. Most had no idea these moves existed. Here's what costs them thousands:

Tax-loss harvesting in US accounts. Sell losing positions before Dec 31, offset gains. One client saved $4,200 by harvesting tech stock losses. The losses carry forward if you don't use them all.

Roth conversion timing with India income. If you had lower US income this year but higher India income, converting traditional IRA to Roth costs less. Your India income doesn't count for US conversion taxes.

Maxing 401k contributions before year-end. Sounds obvious, but 60% of NRIs we surveyed were under-contributing. Every $1,000 you add saves $300-400 in taxes at your bracket.

The timing mistake that kills these strategies: Waiting until late December. Brokerages need 2-3 business days to settle trades. If you decide on Dec 28, you might miss the deadline entirely.

Did you review your year-end tax moves, or are you hoping your CPA catches everything in April?

The difference between proactive and reactive is usually $3,000-$8,000 for most NRIs we work with.

Did you take action on your 2024 year-end tax moves, or are you still waiting?

I moved to the US with a dream and a visa that felt solid. That changed fast. 

When the layoff happened in early 2023, panic set in. A 60-day countdown. My daughter was in second grade. Flights back to India, school changes, everything flashed before me.

I thought skill and savings would protect me. Instead, I realized the H-1B system runs on uncertainty. One job loss, and everything hangs by a thread. The $100,000 new fees being proposed would have made my entry impossible. The constant worry wears you down.

In those weeks, I leaned on my network. Sent 247 job applications in 30 days. Got lucky with an offer just before our 60-day window closed. But some friends weren’t as lucky.

What I learned: **Visa uncertainty isn’t just policy, it’s daily stress for thousands**. You can do everything “right” and still lose your footing. Founders hiring global talent, or anyone considering the H-1B route, need to plan for these storms. Have buffers, know the timelines, lean on community. Hope is not a strategy.

This is the reality many NRIs hide. Talking about it helps, for both founders and families.

539,26,1,5,Industry_Commentary,A,"Same-day inward remittance credit is finally on the horizon for India.

The RBI has released draft norms mandating same-day credit for cross-border remittances received within forex market hours. Banks will need to adopt near real-time reconciliation and straight-through processing. Today, less than 10% of Indian remittances are credited within an hour—compared to over 75% in the US.

This shift could be significant for NRIs and families reliant on quick fund transfers. Delays in remittance settlements often disrupt working capital and lead to uncertainty, especially for time-sensitive expenses. By enforcing **operational benchmarks and transparency**, the RBI is nudging India closer to global payment standards.

For fintech players, this increases both compliance responsibilities and opportunities: providers offering seamless, RBI-compliant experiences may gain a larger share of cross-border flows. The winners will be end-users who get predictable, **faster access to their money**. The move does increase pressure on banks and payment processors to upgrade technology, but the broader benefit is clear.

If you rely on Indian remittance inflows, keep an eye on how your bank or platform adapts. For larger transfers or business-related payments, expect faster access and improved tracking once these guidelines take effect.

How would same-day fund access change your remittance planning or business operations?

540,27,1,5,Industry_Commentary,A,"US to levy 1% tax on outbound remittances starting 2026.

The US will introduce a 1% excise tax on most money sent abroad, effective January 2026. This is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025. Payment providers must collect the tax and remit it quarterly, with key exemptions for certain transfer types.

Why does this matter? The US has historically not taxed outbound remittances, apart from targeted regimes like FATCA. This shift impacts millions who send money to families overseas. Remittances from the US to countries like India and Mexico total over $100 billion a year. For individuals sending $10,000 yearly, it means a new $100 annual cost—noticeable, but not dramatic. The policy aims to capture tax revenue and deter money laundering, though the effect may fall hardest on unbanked and lower-income senders.

For regulated fintechs and banks, compliance complexity will rise. They'll need to update systems, monitor exemptions, and handle reporting. Some providers may raise fees or alter business models. Expect anti-abuse rules to scrutinize creative workarounds. Immigrant communities and small businesses relying on remittance channels should assess their transfer patterns.

If you regularly send money abroad, review upcoming provider disclosures. Plan for a higher total cost from 2026, and consider shifting remittance frequency or methods. For fintech operators, start assessing tax collection processes and customer communications now.

Will a 1% tax change how or how much you remit internationally?

Many NRIs expect a smooth transition home, but residency rules and asset disclosures get tricky fast. US and Indian tax years don’t even align, and one wrong form can trigger audits or penalties much later.

Let's say you move back in July. For the US, you’re a resident until December 31. For India, your tax residency could change if you stay 182 days or more during the fiscal year. If you keep your US savings or 401(k) and don't report them to Indian authorities, that's a violation. You still have to file FATCA (US asset disclosure) and include global income on Indian tax returns from the year your status changes.

I've seen clients stuck with $2,000 FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report) penalties and notices years after their return, simply because they left old accounts open or misjudged their residency start. If your portfolio in the US earns interest or dividends while you’re back in India, it might now be taxable in both countries.

Keep track of your residency date, file your last US returns correctly, and close or disclose overseas accounts as required. It’s not just about tax - it’s about protecting your future financial choices in both countries.

Are you planning to move back permanently this year, or just for a short assignment?
