Source: EY India, September 2025

Context: The RBI released draft Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) Regulations 2025, overhauling the 25-year-old FEMA 8/2000-RB framework governing cross-border corporate guarantees, LCs, and performance bonds. This is part of RBI's broader ""ease of doing business"" initiative to rationalize FEMA compliance.[3]

Why NRIs Care: NRI entrepreneurs with US-India corporate structures, property deals, or joint ventures requiring cross-border guarantees will face simplified approval processes and clearer classification rules—reducing legal ambiguity and approval timelines for capital account transactions.[3]

Search results indicate RBI is modernizing compliance workflows through digitization, real-time data sharing between banks/fintechs/regulators, and API-enabled fintech solutions—signaling regulatory openness to fintech infrastructure.[2][5]

Why NRIs Care: This is the regulatory green light for fintech wealth platforms to build API bridges to RBI-approved banks. NRIs benefit through instant forex conversion, consolidated reporting for FBAR/FATCA, and automated investment initiation—currently fragmented across multiple platforms.[2][5]

**Most NRIs will overpay on 2025 taxes because they miss these three moves.**

December is not just holiday season. It's your last window to reduce your tax bill across both countries.

I talked to 40 NRIs in our last workshop. Most had no idea these moves existed. Here's what costs them thousands:

**The three year-end moves most NRIs miss:**

Tax-loss harvesting in US accounts. Sell losing positions before Dec 31, offset gains. One client saved $4,200 by harvesting tech stock losses. The losses carry forward if you don't use them all.

Roth conversion timing with India income. If you had lower US income this year but higher India income, converting traditional IRA to Roth costs less. Your India income doesn't count for US conversion taxes.

Maxing 401k contributions before year-end. Sounds obvious, but 60% of NRIs we surveyed were under-contributing. Every $1,000 you add saves $300-400 in taxes at your bracket.

**The timing mistake that kills these strategies:**

Waiting until late December. Brokerages need 2-3 business days to settle trades. If you decide on Dec 28, you might miss the deadline entirely.

**One question to ask yourself today:**

Did you review your year-end tax moves, or are you hoping your CPA catches everything in April?

The difference between proactive and reactive is usually $3,000-$8,000 for most NRIs we work with.

It addresses cross-border tax planning (Roth conversion with India income), US tax strategies (tax-loss harvesting, 401k contributions), and emphasizes timing, which is critical for NRIs managing wealth across jurisdictions. While it doesn’t mention FBAR, FATCA, or specific Indian accounts, it scores high for cross-border complexity, actionability, and timeliness.",11/25/2025 12:28pm,Classified,https://airtable.com/tbl4pX2JOyuzfppT3/recRPhBNsrRyLJQOa?blocks=bliPXHTk41mY2g06D,537

Context: The RBI has issued draft norms mandating banks to credit inward cross-border remittances to beneficiary accounts on the same business day if received during forex market hours, with near real-time reconciliation and straight-through processing (STP) required. The move aims to reduce delays, with less than 10% of remittances currently credited within an hour in India versus 75% in the US.  
Why NRIs Care: Faster, more predictable remittance settlements mean less working capital disruption and better cash flow for NRIs sending money to India.

Context: The RBI has released draft Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantees) Regulations, 2025, overhauling the existing FEMA 8/2000-RB framework to rationalize and simplify cross-border guarantee processes for businesses and investors.

Context: The RBI has formalised authorisation requirements for cross-border payment aggregators, tightening oversight on platforms facilitating import/export payments and remittances. Only authorised aggregators can now operate, with strict rules on account usage and transaction monitoring.  
Why NRIs Care: NRIs using fintech platforms for remittances or business payments must ensure their providers are RBI-compliant to avoid legal or settlement risks.
